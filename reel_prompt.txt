## 10-Second Cinematic ASMR Food Reel Prompt: Honeycomb & Cream

**Food:** A piece of golden honeycomb, dripping with thick, amber honey, resting on a small, rustic wooden board. A dollop of clotted cream sits beside it, pure white and inviting.  A tiny silver spoon is placed next to the cream.

**Visuals:**

* **0-3 seconds:** Close-up shot (macro lens) on the honeycomb, focusing on the intricate hexagonal cells.  Light reflects off the honey as it slowly drips, creating glistening highlights. Camera slowly pushes in further.
* **3-6 seconds:**  Shift focus smoothly to the clotted cream. The spoon gently scoops a dollop of cream, pulling it upwards to reveal its thick, textured peaks.
* **6-10 seconds:** The cream-laden spoon gently touches the honeycomb, scooping a small piece with honey and pulling it away.  The honey stretches, forming a thin, glistening strand before breaking. Final shot is a close-up on the spoon, with the honeycomb and cream glistening.


**Sound:**

* **Background:** Gentle, low humming ambient sound, potentially nature sounds like bees buzzing very softly.
* **Featured:** Crisp, close-mic'd sounds of the spoon scraping against the wooden board, the gentle tear as the honeycomb is broken, the soft *plop* of the cream being scooped. Amplify the sticky sounds of the honey stretching and breaking.


**Lighting:** Soft, natural light, mimicking early morning sun. Aim for warm tones that highlight the golden hues of the honey.

**Mood:** Calm, inviting, indulgent.  Focus on the texture and visual appeal of the food to create a sense of craving and satisfaction.

**Editing:** Slow motion throughout, especially during the honey stretching. Use subtle color grading to enhance the warm tones.  End on a satisfying still frame of the honeycomb and cream on the spoon.
